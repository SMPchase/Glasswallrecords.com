    <h1>GLASSWALL RECORDS</h1>
    <p>A label and creative house built for presence — not pretense.</p>

    <h2>Why Here?</h2>
    <p>Based in <strong>Havre de Grace, Maryland</strong>, Glasswall thrives at the intersection of <strong>Baltimore grit</strong> and <strong>Philly soul</strong>. It’s a cultural pressure point with small-town clarity and big-market reach — the kind of place where artists can go quiet just long enough to hear themselves clearly.</p>

    <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
    <p>We're not chasing trends — we're building legacies. Glasswall is an incubator for artistry, ownership, and identity. We don’t do factory sounds. We do real voices, real vision.</p>

    <p>At Glasswall, we don’t just release music — <strong>we build artists</strong>. From vocal growth and creative confidence to identity and direction, we’re hands-on with every layer of your evolution. This is where raw talent becomes undeniable presence.</p>
