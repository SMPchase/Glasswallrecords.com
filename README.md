# Glasswall Records

**Glasswall Records** is a label and creative house built for presence — not pretense.

## 📍 Why Here?
Based in **Havre de Grace, Maryland**, Glasswall thrives at the intersection of **Baltimore grit** and **Philly soul**. It’s a cultural pressure point with small-town clarity and big-market reach — the kind of place where artists can go quiet just long enough to hear themselves clearly.

## 💡 What Sets Us Apart
We're not chasing trends — we're building legacies. Glasswall is an incubator for artistry, ownership, and identity. We don’t do factory sounds. We do real voices, real vision.

## 🎙️ Artist First, Always
At Glasswall, we don’t just release music — we build artists. From vocal growth and creative confidence to identity and direction, we’re hands-on with every layer of your evolution. This is where raw talent becomes undeniable presence.
